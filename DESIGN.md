# Pokemon: War of Ancient Days

## Intro

Moroni:

```
Hello there! Welcome to the Land of Zarahemla!
My name is MORONI. I'm the captain over the armies
of my people, the Nephites.

We are amidst troubling times. A traitor from among
us, AMALICKIAH, has aspired to obtain power.
He has flattered the hearts of many to follow after
him. He has gone to our bretheren, the Lamanites,
to incite them to go to war against us.

I have dispatched many men with swords, cimeters,
and all manner of different types of weapons.
But you will not be fighting with such weapons.

This land is inhabited by creatures we call #MON.
